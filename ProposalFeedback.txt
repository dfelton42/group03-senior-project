Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Plot
=========================

Proposal Document [3 points]:
-----------------------------
Nice work here.  You have described your application very well, and reading
through the first paragraph gives me a general sense of what your 'problem'
is and how you plan to solve it.  The comparison with existing applications
add context.  The features list is good to show what your plan is.

The justification section is also good, short and to the point without just
listing all the courses you took at LMU.  Framing this project and working
on it as an "integration" of your knowledge is a good idea

Proposal Presentation [2 points]:
---------------------------------
Your presentation is very nice, meets all the requirements as listed, and
provides enough detail so the audience can be interested without having so
much text that they can't read it all before the next slide appears.  I
enjoyed the presentation and you answered questions well.  Good audience
reception, too.

Summary:
--------
Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.

5 out of 5 for an A-plus on this deliverable.
