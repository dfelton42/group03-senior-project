==========================================

DETAILED CSC AND CSU DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths
   The document clearly identifies major architectural components
      (Authentication, Event, Host, SupabaseManager, Map Integration, UI
      Components) at a high level.
      Responsibilities for each component are well-defined, which helps in
         understanding their roles.
   Suggestions
      Missing detailed CSC/CSU breakdown: The document does not provide
         detailed descriptions of Component Subsystems (CSCs) and
         Component Subsystem Units (CSUs, i.e., classes or modules).
         Each CSC should list its CSUs with purpose and scope.
      Add rationale for grouping: Explain why certain CSUs belong to a CSC
         and how they interact internally.
      Include lifecycle notes: For each CSU, mention initialization, update,
         and termination behaviors where relevant.

DETAILED CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths
      The architecture hints at classes like SupabaseManager and UI screens,
         which suggests a modular approach.
   Suggestions
      Missing class-level detail: There are no explicit class descriptions,
         fields, methods, or behaviors. Each class should include:
         Purpose and why it exists.
         Attributes (with types and roles).
         Methods (with signatures and responsibilities).
      Add access modifiers and relationships: Indicate whether fields/methods
         are public/private and show inheritance or composition relationships.
      Include error handling notes: For example, how SupabaseManager handles
         failed network calls.

DETAILED INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths
      The document describes module interactions conceptually
         (e.g., UI -> SupabaseManager -> backend).
   Suggestions
      Missing explicit interface details: Interfaces should specify:
         Methods exposed by each module.
         Data types exchanged (e.g., Swift structs, JSON payloads).
         Direction of control flow.
   Add examples: Include pseudocode or method signatures showing how
      modules interact.

DETAILED DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths
      Mentions data models for events, users, RSVPs, and organizations,
         which is a good start.
   Suggestions
      Missing structure definitions: Provide detailed descriptions of these
         data models:
         Attributes, types, constraints (e.g., Event
            {id: UUID, title: String, date: Date }).
         Relationships (e.g., one-to-many between organizations and events).
         Include algorithms or workflows: For example, pseudocode for RSVP
            submission or event filtering.
      Add preconditions/postconditions: For critical routines like
         authentication or event creation.

DETAILED DESIGN DIAGRAMS:
   Strengths
      The document includes architectural diagrams, which is helpful for
         high-level understanding.
   Suggestions
      Missing detailed design diagrams: Add:
         Class diagrams showing attributes, methods, and relationships.
         Sequence diagrams for key workflows (e.g., login, RSVP,
            event creation).
      Ensure alignment with text: Diagrams should reflect the classes and
         interactions described in 6.3.1–6.3.3.

Overall Completeness Assessment
   The document is strong at the architectural level but incomplete at the
      detailed design level. It:
         Defines major components and their responsibilities.
         Includes high-level diagrams and interaction descriptions.
         However, it lacks detailed CSC/CSU breakdowns, class descriptions,
            interface specifications, data structures, and detailed design
            diagrams, which are essential for a full SDD at the detailed
            design stage.
