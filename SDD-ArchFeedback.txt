=======================================

INTRODUCTION SECTION:
   System objectives section
   Hardware, software, and human interfaces section
Both are fine.

ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN SECTION:
   Strengths
      Clear modular separation: The architecture emphasizes separation of
         concerns (UI, data models, SupabaseManager, map module), which
         supports maintainability and scalability.
      Technology stack clarity: Mentions SwiftUI, Supabase SDK, PostgreSQL,
         and Google Maps SDK, showing strong alignment with iOS development
         best practices.
      Low coupling and rationale: Explicitly states the goal of reducing
         dependencies between modules, which is a key architectural principle.
   Suggestions
      Add rationale for architectural style: While modularity is mentioned,
         explicitly stating whether this follows MVC, MVVM, or another
            pattern would improve clarity.
      Include non-functional considerations: Performance, security, and
         scalability aspects could be briefly addressed to strengthen
         architectural justification.
      Expand on data flow: A short summary of how data moves from
         UI -> SupabaseManager -> backend and back would make this section
         more complete.

   Major softwre components section
      Strengths
         Comprehensive component list: Covers Authentication, Event, Host,
            SupabaseManager, Map Integration, and UI components.
         Responsibilities clearly defined: Each component’s role is described
            in terms of functionality (e.g., Authentication for secure login,
            Event module for browsing and filtering).
         Alignment with functional requirements: Components map well to core
            app features like event discovery, RSVP, and host management.
      Suggestions
         Add explicit traceability: Include a mapping between components and
            functional requirements (e.g., FR 5.2.x) for better compliance
            with SDD standards.
         Clarify component boundaries: For example, does the Event module
            handle caching or is that part of SupabaseManager? Adding these
            details would reduce ambiguity.
         Include scalability notes: Indicate how components like
            SupabaseManager will handle increased load or future features
            (e.g., notifications).

   Major software interactions section
      Strengths
         Interaction flow explained: Describes how Authentication interacts
            with Supabase, how Event and Map modules share data, and how Host
            actions propagate through SupabaseManager.
         Future extensibility noted: Mentions planned integration with APNS
            for notifications, showing foresight.
      Suggestions
         Add sequence diagrams or flowcharts: Visual representation of
            interactions (e.g., login flow, event creation) would make this
            section stronger.
         Clarify error handling and edge cases: For example, what happens if
            SupabaseManager fails to retrieve data? Including fallback
            strategies would improve robustness.
         Include data exchange details: Specify what data structures or
            formats are passed between modules (e.g., JSON payloads, Swift
            structs).

   Architectural design diagrams section
      Strengths
         Diagrams included: The document provides architectural diagrams,
            which is essential for visualizing relationships.
         High-level clarity: The diagrams appear to show module
            relationships and possibly data flow.
      Suggestions
         Add labels and legends: Ensure diagrams clearly indicate
            components, interactions, and data flow directions.
         Include multiple views: Consider adding both a component diagram
            and a deployment diagram for completeness.
         Verify alignment with text: Ensure the diagrams match the
            descriptions in 6.2 and 6.2.2 (e.g., SupabaseManager as
            central hub).

Overall Completeness Assessment
   The document is strong and mostly complete at the architectural design
      level for a Waterfall or Agile SDD. It:
         Defines major components and their responsibilities.
         Explains interactions and includes diagrams.
         Shows awareness of modularity and future extensibility.
