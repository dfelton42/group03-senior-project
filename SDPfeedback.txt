Documentation Feedback ~ Deliverable #3
Software Development Plan
CMSI 4071 Fall 2025
=======================================

INTRODUCTION/DELIVERABLES SECTION:
----------------------------------
This section is well-developed and includes all required deliverables with
   due dates, descriptions, and relevant technologies.
The inclusion of screenshots or diagrams (mentioned in the manual section)
   would enhance clarity.

PROJECT RESOURCES SECTION:
----------------------------------
You could briefly mention any testing devices (e.g., iPhone models or
   simulators) if applicable.
Consider specifying versions of tools (e.g., Xcode 15, Swift 5.9) for
   reproducibility.

PROJECT ORGANIZATION SECTION:
----------------------------------
Consider adding a brief note on communication tools (Slack, email,
   meetings) and decision-making protocols.
A visual org chart could enhance clarity but is not required.

PROJECT SCHEDULE SECTION:
----------------------------------
The chart is detailed and well-structured.
Consider including milestones or dependencies between tasks for better
   visualization of sequencing.
A link to the Jira board is provided, which presumably contains the
   task/resource breakdown.  While the link is helpful, a brief summary or
   sample of the table in the document would improve accessibility.
Ensure the Jira board is publicly viewable or accessible to reviewers.
