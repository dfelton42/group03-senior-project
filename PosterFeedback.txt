Nice job on this, art-wise, it's very appealing.  I like the dual column
   layout ~ a nice break from the three columns that everyone else seems
   to be using.

Unfortunately, it won't quite fly for printing:
   * The background is too dark.  Consider making it a gradient so that
      it fades from one side to the other or from top to bottom or corner
      to corner.  This will keep Masao happy and help prevent him from
      kicking it back.
   * You need your pictures in addition to your names; Masao won't print
      it without that.
   * Remember that this poster is THREE FEET TALL ~ you have TONS of room
      to put more information in the text boxes.  What you have is good,
      but you could put more.
   * Remember that the text is going to be HUGE as you've done it, so
      keep that in mind.
   * You also need the text "CMSI 4071" and "Fall 2025" on there
      somewhere; Masao won't print it without that.
   * The version you put in your repository can't be opened with Acrobat.
      I renamed it to "Poster.pdf" but still no joy so I put it back.
      Please make sure that is a PDF, that it is 48" wide by 36" high,
      and make sure that it can be opened using Adobe.

I'm sorry to have to give you so many things to do, but I know what Masao
   will and will not accept and that is kind of the ultimate driving force
   for the comments.  I really like the poster as-is and you did a good
   job with it.  It's artful, colorful, and thoughtfully arranged.

When you make those changes, send a copy to Masao for printing.  His
   e-mail address is:
