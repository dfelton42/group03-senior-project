problem 2, Mostly correct, though standard Agile phases are requirements,
   design, implementation, testing, and review.  While initial planning
   helps, repeating phases ensures adaptability and prevents costly rework.

problem 5, your statements are too general; they are reasonable but lack
   depth compared to best practice guidance.  Assumptions are acceptable if
   they are validated early.  Large user stories should be split into small
   tasks for better estimation and progress tracking.

problem 6, Incorrect for second blank (User Story instead of Estimate) and
   last blank (Blueskying instead of Planning Poker).

problem 9, Good reasoning but could include risks of poor communication.

problem 10, Acceptable but lacks personal insight.

nice work!
