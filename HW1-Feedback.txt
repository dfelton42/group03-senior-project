Homework Assignment #1
CMSI 4071 Fall 2025
======================

SUMMARY:
The essay provides a clear and accurate summary of the ValuJet 592 incident.
It outlines the sequence of events leading to the crash, including the
initial signs of trouble, the rapid escalation, and the ultimate failure of
the aircraft.

The essay effectively identifies the root causes of the disaster: mishandling
of hazardous materials, lack of proper safety protocols, regulatory oversight
failures, and systemic breakdowns.

The essay references the roles of ValuJet, SabreTech, and the FAA, and
explains how their actions (or inactions) contributed to the tragedy.

The narrative is well-structured and easy to follow, with a logical flow from
the incident to the investigation and its findings.

The essay goes beyond recounting events by analyzing the systemic nature of the
failure and drawing analogies to biological systems, which adds depth to the
summary.

CRITICAL THINKING:
The essay draws strong parallels between the ValuJet incident and software
engineering, particularly in the context of system complexity, communication,
and responsibility.

The analogy between SabreTech and a negligent software team is well-developed.
The essay emphasizes the importance of testing, communication, and shared
responsibility between developers and clients.

The essay touches on key software engineering practices: code review, testing,
documentation, communication, and risk management. It also highlights ethical
responsibilities, which is a critical aspect of engineering.

The points made are grounded in real-world software development practices. The
essay avoids overly abstract or unrealistic suggestions.

The section is well-organized, with clear transitions and logical progression
from one idea to the next. The writing is articulate and professional.

Final Summary
The application to software engineering is thoughtful, relevant, and well-
articulated, demonstrating a strong understanding of both the article and its
implications for engineering practice.

This essay is a strong and well-executed assignment. It provides a compelling
and accurate synopsis of the ValuJet 592 article and thoughtfully applies its
lessons to software engineering. The analogies drawn between aviation safety
failures and software development risks are insightful and effectively
highlight the importance of communication, testing, and ethical responsibility
in engineering.

Well done!
